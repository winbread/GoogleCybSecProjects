# GoogleCybSecProjects
Practical cybersecurity labs using Linux/Bash to install and verify security tools (e.g., Suricata, tcpdump), manage software with APT, and use core commands for file/process permissions and basic networking. Practiced secure remote administration via SSH and documented steps clearly for repeatable results.
